May 7 marks the birth anniversary of one of India’s most loved, respected and influential poets of all time – 
Rabindranath Tagore. Fondly called Gurudev, a sobriquet given by none other than Mahatma Gandhi, Tagore didn’t only shape 
Bengali literature, but his contribution to the nationalist movement and with his music and poems is well known.
<br><br>
		Born in 1861, Tagore’s most famous work is of course the profoundly sensitive Gitanjali, which won him the 
Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913, making him not only the first Indian to win the prestigious honour but also the first 
non-European.
<br><br>
		His legacy now lives on in the Indian national anthem Jan Gana Mana, as well as through Santiniketan – which 
was established by his father Devendranath Tagore – that was later expanded into the Visva Bharti University.
<br><br>
		A cultural icon, his work bears testimony to his immeasurable talent and his great foresight. It would not be 
too far-fetched to claim that the bard has written about every emotion that does exists. Such is the power of his words that 
people of all ages connect with them at various levels, be it a child or an nonagenarian. Each would draw their own unique 
interpretations.
